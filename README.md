# Depression-Analysis-Web-Application
The Depression Analysis Web Application is a simple and accessible tool designed to help users assess their mental well-being using the PHQ-9 questionnaire, a clinically validated screening method for depression. This user-friendly web app allows individuals to reflect on their emotions over the past two weeks and receive helpful insights based on their responses.

🔑 Key Features

The app includes 9 questions focused on mood, energy, sleep, and overall mental health. Users select how often they've experienced certain symptoms, using a scale from "Not at all" to "Nearly every day."

Personalized Feedback:
After completing the questionnaire, users receive a score that indicates the level of depressive symptoms—ranging from minimal to severe. Based on the result, the app provides thoughtful suggestions and encouragement.

Calming Exercise Section:
To promote emotional well-being, users can explore a calming space featuring motivational quotes and guided breathing exercises. These simple tools are designed to reduce stress and anxiety.

Mental Health Helpline Info:
The app includes contact information for mental health support services, giving users access to professional help when needed.
