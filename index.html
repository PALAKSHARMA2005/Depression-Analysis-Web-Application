            <p>Take a deep breath in... and out. Repeat this for 5 minutes.</p>
            <div class="quotes">
                <p>Please remember that you’re capable, brave and loved – even when it feels like you’re not.</p>
                <p>Do not give the past the power to define your future.</p>
                <p>Perhaps you’ve been assigned this mountain to show others that it can be moved.</p>
                <p>Just a reminder: it is NOT selfish to put your recovery first. Rather, it’s necessary in order to make sure that everything else doesn’t come last.</p>
                <p>Small, baby steps each day add up to huge, giant leaps over time. So, please keep going. Do NOT give up.</p>
                <p>You are not worthless, you are not a failure, and you are not a loser. That voice saying you are is just your depression trying to trick you.</p>
                <p>On those really difficult days when it seems impossible to go on and you feel like giving up, just remind yourself that you’ve been there before and you’ve survived every time, so you can survive this time, too.</p>
                <p>Even the darkest hour only has 60 minutes.</p>
